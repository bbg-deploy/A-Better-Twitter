h1. This is the Brian Dear basic rails app template.

p. Rather than continually going through the same basic config every time I create a new Rails 3.2 application, I created some boilerplate code that can form the basis of other projects.

p. The Gemfile doesn't include everything, but it does include the gems that I use on every project.

* hashrocket-rails (This includes haml-rails and decent_exposure)
* pg
* capybara
* dirty -- runs uncommitted tests for things not yet committed
* heroku
* pry-nav
* pry-rails
* spork
* rails-erd
* sass-rails
* coffee-rails
* uglifier

p. There are a few other pieces of goodness, for example a UI controller/view that provides a safe place to test views before implementing them in the production app.

p. Also there's also an html5 shiv, flash rendering, a head yield as well as doing some organization of the stylesheets.
